				<h2> TUMO CENTER</h2>
					Armenian: Թումո ստեղծարար տեխնոլոգիաների կենտրոն) is a free of charge 
					digital media learning center in Yerevan, Armenia. Since its opening in 2011,
					the center has provided thousands of students aged 12–18 an open 
					environment where they can use the latest in digital tools, learn from media
					professionals,
					and explore the intersection of technology and art.
					Tumo is a non-profit venture founded by Sam and Sylva 
					Simonian who fully fund its educational program through the Simonian 
					Educational Foundation.
					Students at Tumo advance through the center’s learning program based on
					their individual preferences and at their own pace. Within that flexible
					framework, they work towards very specific learning targets organized around
					four focus areas: animation, game development, web development, and digital media.
					Tumo members are initially encouraged to get exposure to all four of Tumo’s
					focus areas. As they progress through the curriculum, completing a succession 
					of increasingly challenging projects, members begin to concentrate on one of
					the four areas and work towards completion of a final project at the end of a 
					two-year cycle.[5]
					In addition to instruction in its main focus areas, the Tumo curriculum covers
					a set of supporting technical, artistic and professional skills. These include
					computer programming, 3D modeling, 2D graphics, drawing, music, writing, online 
					literacy and communication.
					Members create their own personal learning plans as a path through the 
					Tumo World, a game-like virtual environment designed to facilitate 
					navigating the multifaceted curriculum. As they complete activities 
					in the form of tutorials, exercises and projects, they are supported
